This project explores predictive modeling of NBA player performance at the game level using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical player data, I developed and evaluated models including Linear Regression and Random Forest to forecast player statistics such as points, rebounds, and assists. The workflow incorporates feature engineering with time-based and interaction variables, as well as statistical validation and prediction intervals to assess accuracy and quantify uncertainty. The goal of the project is to demonstrate applied data science skills in model development, evaluation, and interpretation, while highlighting approaches to real-world sports analytics problems. The attached notebook has multiple versions of my code and you can see the process and improvements along the way, the final and most recent version is at the bottom of the notebook.
